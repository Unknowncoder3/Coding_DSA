# 📚 Coding DSA — Core Programming & Problem Solving

Welcome to **Coding DSA** 👋
This repository documents my **structured practice of programming fundamentals and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** using Python.

The goal of this repo is to **build strong logical thinking, clean coding habits, and algorithmic intuition** — the foundation required for **software engineering, backend development, and AI systems**.

> 🔹 This repository complements my real-world AI and full-stack projects by strengthening core problem-solving skills.

## 🎯 Why This Repository Exists

Many projects focus only on frameworks or AI APIs.
This repository focuses on **what actually matters underneath**:

* Logical thinking
* Control flow mastery
* Algorithm execution clarity
* Code readability and correctness

This repo is ideal for:

* Interview preparation
* Revising DSA concepts
* Understanding *how* and *why* algorithms work
* Building confidence in core programming
